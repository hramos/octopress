Personal finance site Mint.com has debuted its Android app today, which lets Mint.com users access a complete snapshot of their financial picture and manage their finances on the go. Mint.com, a TechCrunch40 company that was acquired by Intuit for $170 million last fall, initially announced the development of the free app last November.

With the release of the Android app, along with [Friday&#8217;s events](http://www.popular.com/westernbank/index-en.html), even more Puerto Ricans will be able to use Mint to manage their finances while on the move.

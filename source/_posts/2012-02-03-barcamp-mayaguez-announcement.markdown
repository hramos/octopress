[Barcamp Mayagüez](http://startupsofpuertorico.com/barcamp/) will be taking place on February 28, 2012 at Madridz. The [first two Barcamps in Puerto Rico](http://barcampsj.org) were held in San Juan, and now its time to shift our attention to the west coast. Giovanni Collazo and José Padilla, through [Startups of Puerto Rico](http://www.startupsofpuertorico.com), have recruited a group of UPR Mayagüez engineering students to take charge of the logistics of the event. Hopefully, Barcamp Mayagüez will serve as a catalyst to other similarly themed events in the future. It is time to nip [the problem](http://www.hectorramos.com/startups-of-puerto-rico/) in the bud and inspire our fellow college students.

Barcamp Mayagüez is open to everyone, just make sure to [confirm your assistance on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/174045022700218/).

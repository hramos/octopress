[H&eacute;ctor](http://about.me/hramos) worked as a systems architect for four years in the [financial technology industry](http://www.evertecinc.com/) before turning to [mobile app development](http://polsense.com). H&eacute;ctor is most at ease in front of an Xcode window, but he is also a skilled Java developer with a new-found love for Ruby. His favorite kind of app requires [a hefty backend](https://parse.com) behind it.

H&eacute;ctor has been actively promoting startups, teaming up with a group of entrepreneurs to launch the Startups of Puerto Rico initiative which helped organize [Barcamps](http://barcampsj.org/), [Startup Weekends](http://puertorico.startupweekend.org/), and the first [TEDx conference to be held in Puerto Rico](http://www.tedxsanjuan.com).

H&eacute;ctor graduated from the [University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez](http://www.uprm.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. He is an Engineer-in-Training and member of the San Juan Chapter and [Instituto de Ingenieros de Computadora](http://www.iicomciapr.org/) of the [Colegio of Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico](http://www.ciapr.org).

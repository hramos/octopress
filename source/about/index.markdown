I'm [H&eacute;ctor](http://about.me/hramos) and I work at [Polsense](http://polsense.com), a mobile app incubator based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We pride ourselves in making great, custom built apps.

I live in Puerto Rico right now. Went to college and got a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [UPR Mayag√ºez](http://www.uprm.edu), worked at [EVERTEC](http://www.evertecinc.com) for a few years as a System Architect, but then in 2008 I decided to take up Objective-C and seek a career in iPhone app development. By 2010 I was able to quit and pursue this career full-time with Polsense. Some day I'll move to San Francisco. Prepare to hear that a lot from me - I've been saying it since my first visit in 2009, but I'm still here.

I'm doing my part to help move forward the startup scene in Puerto Rico. Check out [Startups of Puerto Rico](http://www.startupsofpuertorico.com). Also helped organize [TEDxSanJuan 2011](http://www.tedxsanjuan.com). 

If you're looking to get in touch with me with regards to iOS development services, you should contact us at [info@polsense.com](mailto:info@polsense.com) instead. Let me know if you're in Puerto Rico any time soon, otherwise, see you when WWDC comes around.

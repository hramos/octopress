[H&eacute;ctor](http://about.me/hramos) is a systems architect turned mobile app developer. He wrote software that handles [sensitive banking information](http://www.evertecinc.com), and later co-founded a [mobile app development company](http://polsense.com). H&eacute;ctor is a native iOS app developer, and a Java and Ruby backend developer.

H&eacute;ctor has been actively promoting startups in Puerto Rico, teaming up with a group of entrepreneurs to launch the [Startups of Puerto Rico](http://www.startupsofpuertorico.com) initiative which helps organize [Barcamps](http://barcampsj.org/), [Startup Weekends](http://puertorico.startupweekend.org/) and other [startup-oriented events](http://albedrio.com/albedrio/?p=1169665746).

He is also quite comfortable with Unix, having administered a small Linux computer lab for the Physics Department at University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez.
